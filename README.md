# Car_Market_Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a multivariate dataset featuring family income, loan history, and vehicle choices to identify correlations in purchasing power.
Implemented K-Means Clustering to segment the data into distinct income groups, effectively categorizing customers based on financial profiles.
Visualized clusters and relationships between car price and loan frequency using Matplotlib/Seaborn, revealing key insights into affordability and credit reliance across different demographics.
In this project, I analyzed a complex dataset to understand the relationship between socioeconomic factors specifically family income and existing loan burdens—and vehicle purchasing decisions. My goal was to determine if distinct "customer profiles" could be identified based on financial constraints.
